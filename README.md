# contactapp â€” the sample for AngularJS apps

It is a Tutorial smaple about RESTful API , I got it from a YouTube vdio. 


## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the angular-seed repository and install the dependencies:

### Prerequisites

You need git to clone the angular-seed repository. You can get git from
[http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/).

We also use a number of node.js tools to initialize and test angular-seed. You must have node.js and
its package manager (npm) installed.  You can get them from [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).

### Clone angular-seed

Clone the angular-seed repository using [git][git]:

```
git clone https://github.com/BingoTrai/ContactApp.git
```


### Install Dependencies

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and angular framework code.  The tools help
us manage and test the application.

* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [node package manager][npm].

 so we can simply do:

```
npm install
```



### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server.  The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
node server.js
```

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:3000/index.html`.
